      <description>I’m an Analytics and Management (MAM) student at London Business School (2021) currently on my educational leave from Bain &amp;amp; Company. I’m strongly interested in the intersection of technology and management with a focus on data analytics and behavioral biometrics. During my time at Bain, I gained experience in commercial diligence work as part of the Private Equity Group as well as Customer Experience (NPS) transformation.
Being a Business Graduate from the University of Mannheim, I was part of the IBEA program studying at ESSEC Business School (Singapore), FGV EBAPE (Rio de Janeiro), and Darla Moore School of Business (Columbia).</description>

      <description>Introduction (Part 1: Data cleaning + EDA)The following project focuses on the analysis of an AirBnB dataset. As part of the project I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data visualization as well as Regression Analysis. The final output is a multivariate regression model that predicts the total cost of two people to stay at an AirBnB property in Beijing for 4 nights. For the purpose of this work display I’ll present a smaller subset of analyses and visualizations that were part of the larger project.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn our data driven world the visualization of data is an essential skill in order to transport meaningful messages. It allows us to go beyond the mere analysis of data for the sake of analysis. The following collection of visualizations in R using ggplot are a representation of my work at London Business School in the process of enhancing my skills in the field. I will regularly add new visualizations going forward.</description>
