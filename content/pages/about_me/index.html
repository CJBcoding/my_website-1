<p><img src="Fabian%20Sinn_picture.png" /></p>
<p>I’m an Analytics and Management (MAM) student at London Business School (2021) currently on my educational leave from Bain &amp; Company. I’m strongly interested in the intersection of technology and management with a focus on data analytics and behavioral biometrics. During my time at Bain, I gained experience in commercial diligence work as part of the Private Equity Group as well as Customer Experience (NPS) transformation.</p>
<p>Being a Business Graduate from the University of Mannheim, I was part of the IBEA program studying at ESSEC Business School (Singapore), FGV EBAPE (Rio de Janeiro), and Darla Moore School of Business (Columbia). Being part of a cohort of 40 international students, with diverse cultural backgrounds, I learned that intercultural competencies cannot be taught but need to be developed over time.</p>
<p>During my studies at Mannheim I was involved in a broad range of projects and initiatives ranging from chairing the largest student finance society in Germany, AK Boerse (AKB), to founding Q-Summit - the largest student run Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation conference in Germany.</p>
<p>I see opportunities where passionate individuals come together to solve the hardest challenges at hand. I perform best in high-paced team environments and believe that collaboration and hard work always outperform mere talent.</p>
<p>Please reach out if you are interested in opportunities to partner with Q-Summit (Collaboration, Sponsorship), are a young startup looking for support in the Mannheim/Rhine-Neckar region, or just want to exchange ideas at the intersection of tech and business.</p>
